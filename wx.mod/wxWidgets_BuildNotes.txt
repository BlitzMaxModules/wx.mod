Build Notes
-----------

Linux :

    wxGTK 2.9.x
    ./configure --enable-unicode --with-opengl --enable-graphics_ctx --enable-mediactrl --disable-shared

    add "--disable-shared" for static libraries
    using "--enable-mediactrl" requires gstreamer installation
    
    make
    make install (as root) (not required for static libraries)
   
    Static .a files are built to the "lib" folder.

    The build-specific headers are located in "lib/wx"

    After copying the libs, you need to change a folder name, as it contains a -2.x suffix which we don't need.
    Go into wx.mod/lib/<build>/wx/include/
    You'll see something like mac-unicode-release-static-2.8
    Remove the -2.8, so that it becomes mac-unicode-release-static

	Note : to build with wxMediaCtrl you will need the gstreamer dev packages. something like libgstreamer-0.10-dev.

MacOS :

    wxMac 2.9.x
    ./configure --enable-unicode --with-opengl --enable-mediactrl --enable-graphics_ctx --disable-shared --with-expat=builtin --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libpng=builtin CC=gcc-4.0 CXX=g++-4.0 LD=g++-4.0

    use "--disable-shared" for static libraries, otherwise you get .dylibs

    make
    for a shared install use
        sudo make install  (requires admin password)

    For PPC build on Intel

        export CPPFLAGS="-arch ppc"
        export LDFLAGS="-arch ppc"
        ./configure --enable-unicode --with-opengl --enable-mediactrl --enable-graphics_ctx --disable-shared --with-expat=builtin --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libpng=builtin --with-macosx-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk --with-macosx-version-min=10.4

        make


Win32 :

    wxMSW 2.9.x
    
    edit build/msw/config.gcc, and change the following entries :
            BUILD := release
            UNICODE = 1
            USE_OPENGL = 1
            USE_GDIPLUS := 1

    Also, edit wx/msw/setup0.h and enable wxUSE_GLCANVAS :
            #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       1
            #define wxUSE_GRAPHICS_CONTEXT 1
            #define wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM  0

    NOTE : These two definitions will appear in the setup.h inside the lib folder. If you failed to set them initially when building, you should
    apply the changes to setup.h also.

    make -f makefile.gcc

    creates static .a files in lib\gcc_lib

	Also need to include libwinspool.a, librpcrt4.a and libodbc32.a in the lib folder for distribution. (these come from
	the MinGW distribution)
    
	NOTE : if you get an error building, which mentions an invalid abs( &double) call in graphics.cpp, you can change the
	errored call to use fabs instead :

          if( fabs(sweepAngle) >= 2*M_PI)

    NOTES on wxUSE_STD_IOSTREAM : 2.9.0 appears to set this to 1 by default on Win32 now. Except that it breaks (at least) wxDocument SaveObject()
    so, I'm building with this disabled in order to use wx streams instead of c++ iostreams - which is better for BlitzMax.
