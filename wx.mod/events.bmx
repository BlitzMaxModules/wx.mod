	In general, it is recommended to skip all non-command events to allow the default handling to take

	button click or menu item selection must only be processed by one handler.

bbdoc: This event type contains information about window and session close events.
about: The handler function for EVT_CLOSE is called when the user has tried to close a a frame or
dialog box using the window manager (X) or system menu (Windows). It can also be invoked by the
application itself programmatically, for example by calling the wxWindow::Close function.
<p>
You should check whether the application is forcing the deletion of the window using wxCloseEvent::CanVeto.
If this is false, you must destroy the window using wxWindow::Destroy. If the return value is true,
it is up to you whether you respond by destroying the window.
</p>
<p>
If you don't destroy the window, you should call wxCloseEvent::Veto to let the calling code know that
you did not destroy the window. This allows the wxWindow::Close function to return true or false depending
on whether the close instruction was honoured or not.

bbdoc: This type is not used by the event handlers by itself, but is a base class for other event classes (such as wxNotebookEvent).
about: It (or an object of a derived type) is sent when the controls state is being changed and allows

	Rem
	bbdoc: Prevents the change announced by this event from happening.
	about: It is in general a good idea to notify the user about the reasons for vetoing the change

bbdoc: A size event holds information about size change events.
about: You may wish to use this for frames to resize their child windows as appropriate.
<p>
Note that the size passed is of the whole window: call wxWindow::GetClientSize for the area which may be
used by the application.
</p>
<p>
When a window is resized, usually only a small part of the window is damaged and you may only need to repaint
that area. However, if your drawing depends on the size of the window, you may need to clear the DC explicitly
and repaint the whole window. In which case, you may need to call wxWindow::Refresh to invalidate the entire window.

bbdoc: A paint event is sent when a window's contents needs to be repainted.
about: Please notice that in general it is impossible to change the drawing of a standard control
(such as wxButton) and so you shouldn't attempt to handle paint events for them as even if it might
work on some platforms, this is inherently not portable and won't work everywhere.

Rem
bbdoc: A scroll event holds information about events sent from stand-alone scrollbars and sliders.
about: Note that unless specifying a scroll control identifier, you will need to test for scrollbar

Rem
bbdoc: This type is used for idle events, which are generated when the system becomes idle.
about: Note that, unless you do something specifically, the idle events are not sent if the system remains idle
once it has become it, e.g. only a single idle event will be generated until something else resulting in more normal
events happens and only then is the next idle event sent again. If you need to ensure a continuous stream of idle
events, you can either use RequestMore method in your handler or call wxWakeUpIdle periodically (for example from
timer event), but note that both of these approaches (and especially the first one) increase the system load and so
should be avoided if possible.
<p>
By default, idle events are sent to all windows (and also wxApp, as usual). If this is causing a significant
overhead in your application, you can call wxIdleEvent::SetMode with the value wxIDLE_PROCESS_SPECIFIED, and set the
wxWS_EX_PROCESS_IDLE extra window style for every window which should receive idle events.
</p>
End Rem
Type wxIdleEvent Extends wxEvent

	Function create:wxEvent(wxEventPtr:Byte Ptr, evt:TEventHandler)

Rem
bbdoc: This event type contains information about keypress (character) events.
about: Notice that there are three different kinds of keyboard events in wxWidgets: key down and up events and
char events. The difference between the first two is clear - the first corresponds to a key press and the second
to a key release - otherwise they are identical. Just note that if the key is maintained in a pressed state you
will typically get a lot of (automatically generated) down events but only one up so it is wrong to assume that
there is one up event corresponding to each down one.
<p>
Both key events provide untranslated key codes while the char event carries the translated one. The untranslated
code for alphanumeric keys is always an upper case value. For the other keys it is one of WXK_XXX values from the
keycodes table. The translated key is, in general, the character the user expects to appear as the result of the key
combination when typing the text into a text entry zone, for example.
</p>
<p>
A few examples to clarify this (all assume that CAPS LOCK is unpressed and the standard US keyboard): when the
'A' key is pressed, the key down event key code is equal to ASCII A = 65. But the char event key code is ASCII
a = 97. On the other hand, if you press both SHIFT and 'A' keys simultaneously , the key code in key down event
will still be just 'A' while the char event key code parameter will now be 'A' as well.
</p>
<p>
Although in this simple case it is clear that the correct key code could be found in the key down event handler by
checking the value returned by ShiftDown(), in general you should use EVT_CHAR for this as for non-alphanumeric keys
the translation is keyboard-layout dependent and can only be done properly by the system itself.
</p>
<p>
Another kind of translation is done when the control key is pressed: for example, for CTRL-A key press the key down
event still carries the same key code 'a' as usual but the char event will have key code of 1, the ASCII value of
this key combination.
</p>
<p>
You may discover how the other keys on your system behave interactively by running the text wxWidgets sample and
pressing some keys in any of the text controls shown in it.
</p>
<p>
Note: If a key down (wxEVT_KEY_DOWN) event is caught and the event handler does not call event.Skip() then the
corresponding char event (wxEVT_CHAR) will not happen. This is by design and enables the programs that handle both
types of events to be a bit simpler.
</p>
<p>
Note for Windows programmers: The key and char events in wxWidgets are similar to but slightly different from
Windows WM_KEYDOWN and WM_CHAR events. In particular, Alt-x combination will generate a char event in wxWidgets
(unless it is used as an accelerator).
</p>
<p>
Tip: be sure to call event.Skip() for events that you don't process in key event function, otherwise menu
shortcuts may cease to work under Windows.

	and forgetting to do it can result in serious program bugs (e.g. program not working with European keyboard
	layout where ALTGR key which is seen by the program as combination of CTRL and ALT is used). On the other hand,
	you can simply write
