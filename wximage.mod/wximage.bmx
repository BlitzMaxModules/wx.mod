bbdoc: This type encapsulates a platform-independent image.
about: An image can be created from data, or using wxBitmap::ConvertToImage. An image can be loaded from a
file in a variety of formats, and is extensible to new formats via image format handlers. Functions are
available to set and get image bits, so it can be used for basic image manipulation.
<p>
A wxImage cannot (currently) be drawn directly to a wxDC. Instead, a platform-specific wxBitmap object must be
created from it using the wxBitmap::wxBitmap(wxImage,int depth) constructor. This bitmap can then be drawn in
a device context, using wxDC::DrawBitmap.
</p>
<p>
One colour value of the image may be used as a mask colour which will lead to the automatic creation of a wxMask
object associated to the bitmap object.
</p>
<h3>Alpha channel support</h3>
<p>
Starting from wxWidgets 2.5.0 wxImage supports alpha channel data, that is in addition to a byte for the red,
green and blue colour components for each pixel it also stores a byte representing the pixel opacity. An alpha
value of 0 corresponds to a transparent pixel (null opacity) while a value of 255 means that the pixel is 100% opaque.
</p>
<p>
Unlike RGB data, not all images have an alpha channel and before using GetAlpha you should check if this image
contains an alpha channel with HasAlpha. Note that currently only images loaded from PNG files with transparency
information will have an alpha channel but alpha support will be added to the other formats as well (as well as
support for saving images with alpha channel which also isn't implemented).
</p>
<h3>Available Image Handlers</h3>
<p>
The following image handlers are available. wxBMPHandler is always installed by default. To use other image formats, install the appropriate handler with wxImage::AddHandler or call wxInitAllImageHandlers.
wxBMPHandler 
For loading and saving, always installed. 
wxPNGHandler 
For loading (including alpha support) and saving. 
wxJPEGHandler 
For loading and saving. 
wxGIFHandler 
Only for loading, due to legal issues. 
wxPCXHandler 
For loading and saving (see below). 
wxPNMHandler 
For loading and saving (see below). 
wxTIFFHandler 
For loading and saving. 
wxTGAHandler 
For loading only. 
wxIFFHandler 
For loading only. 
wxXPMHandler 
For loading and saving. 
wxICOHandler 
For loading and saving. 
wxCURHandler 
For loading and saving. 
wxANIHandler 
For loading only. 
When saving in PCX format, wxPCXHandler will count the number of different colours in the image; if there are 256 or less colours, it will save as 8 bit, else it will save as 24 bit.
Loading PNMs only works for ASCII or raw RGB images. When saving in PNM format, wxPNMHandler will always save as raw RGB.
