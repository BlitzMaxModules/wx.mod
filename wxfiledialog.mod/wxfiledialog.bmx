bbdoc: Pops up a file selector box.
about: In Windows, this is the common file selector dialog. In X, this is a file selector box with the same
functionality. The path and filename are distinct elements of a full file pathname. If path is empty, the current
directory will be used. If filename is empty, no default filename will be supplied. The wildcard determines what
files are displayed in the file selector, and file extension supplies a type extension for the required filename.
Flags may be a combination of wxOPEN, wxSAVE, wxOVERWRITE_PROMPT or wxFILE_MUST_EXIST. Note that wxMULTIPLE can only
be used with wxFileDialog and not here as this function only returns a single file name.
<p>
Both the Unix and Windows versions implement a wildcard filter. Typing a filename containing wildcards
(*, ?) in the filename text item, and clicking on Ok, will result in only those files matching the pattern being
displayed.
</p>
<p>
The wildcard may be a specification for multiple types of file with a description for each, such as:
<pre>"BMP files (*.bmp)|*.bmp|GIF files (*.gif)|*.gif"</pre>
</p>
