	about: For example, if a window is scrolled 10 pixels to the bottom, the device coordinates of
	the origin are (0, 0) (as always), but the logical coordinates are (0, 10) and so the call
	to CalcScrolledPosition(0, 10, xx, yy) will return 0 in yy.

	bbdoc: Enable or disable physical scrolling in the given direction.
	about: Physical scrolling is the physical transfer of bits up or down the screen when a scroll event
	occurs. If the application scrolls by a variable amount (e.g. if there are different font sizes)
	then physical scrolling will not work, and you should switch it off. Note that you will have to
	reposition child windows yourself, if physical scrolling is disabled.
