bbdoc: An icon is a small rectangular bitmap usually used for denoting a minimized application.
about: It differs from a wxBitmap in always having a mask associated with it for transparent drawing.
On some platforms, icons and bitmaps are implemented identically, since there is no real distinction
between a wxBitmap with a mask and an icon; and there is no specific icon format on some platforms
(X-based applications usually standardize on XPMs for small bitmaps and icons). However, some platforms
(such as Windows) make the distinction, so a separate class is provided.
