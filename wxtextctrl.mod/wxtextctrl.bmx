bbdoc: A text control allows text to be displayed and edited.

Type wxTextCtrl Extends wxControl

	Rem
	bbdoc: Constructor, creating and showing a text control.
	about: The horizontal scrollbar (wxHSCROLL style flag) will only be created for multi-line
	text controls. Without a horizontal scrollbar, text lines that don't fit in the control's size will
	be wrapped (but no newline character is inserted). Single line controls don't have a horizontal
	scrollbar, the text is automatically scrolled so that the insertion point is always visible.
	End Rem

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Appends the text to the end of the text control.
	about: After the text is appended, the insertion point will be at the end of the text control.
	If this behaviour is not desired, the programmer should use GetInsertionPoint and SetInsertionPoint.
	End Rem
	Method AppendText(text:String)
		bmx_wxtextctrl_appendtext(wxObjectPtr, text)
	End Method
	
	Rem

	False otherwise.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the insertion point.
	about: This is defined as the zero based index of the character position to the right of the insertion point.
	For example, if the insertion point is at the end of the text control, it is equal to both GetValue().Length()
	and GetLastPosition().
	End Rem

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the number of lines in the text control buffer.
	about: Note that even empty text controls have one line (where the insertion point is), so
	GetNumberOfLines() never returns 0.
	<p>
	The number of physical lines in the control is returned.
	</p>
	<p>
	Also note that you may wish to avoid using functions that work with line numbers if you are
	working with controls that contain large amounts of text as this function has O(N) complexity
	for N being the number of lines.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the string containing the text starting in the positions from and up to to in the control.
	about: The positions must have been returned by another wxTextCtrl method.
	<p>
	Please note that the positions in a multiline wxTextCtrl do <b>not</b> correspond to the indices in the
	string returned by GetValue because of the different new line representations (CR or CR LF) and so this
	method should be used to obtain the correct results instead of extracting parts of the entire value.
	It may also be more efficient, especially if the control contains a lot of data.

	about: If the returned values are equal, there was no selection.
	<p>
	Please note that the indices returned may be used with the other wxTextctrl methods but don't
	necessarily represent the correct indices into the string returned by GetValue() for multiline
	controls under Windows (at least,) you should use GetStringSelection() to get the selected text.

	controls containing big amounts of text.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Changes the default style to use for the new text which is going to be added to the control using WriteText or AppendText.
	about: If either of the font, foreground, or background colour is not set in style, the values of the previous
	default style are used for them. If the previous default style didn't set them neither, the global font or
	colours of the text control itself are used as fall back.
	<p>
	However if the style parameter is the default wxTextAttr, then the default style is just reset (instead of
	being combined with the new style which wouldn't change it at all).

		bmx_wxtextctrl_setinsertionpointend(wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: This function sets the maximum number of characters the user can enter into the control.
	about: In other words, it allows to limit the text value length to len not counting the terminating NUL character.
	<p>
	If len is 0, the previously set max length limit, if any, is discarded and the user may enter as much text as
	the underlying native text control widget supports (typically at least 32Kb).
	</p>
	<p>
	If the user tries to enter more characters into the text control when it already is filled up to the maximal
	length, a wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_MAXLEN event is sent to notify the program about it (giving it the possibility
	to show an explanatory message, for example) and the extra input is discarded.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that under GTK+, this function may only be used with single line text controls.

		bmx_wxtextctrl_setstyle(wxObjectPtr, fromPos, toPos, style.wxTextAttrPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Sets the text value and marks the control as not-modified (which means that IsModified would return false immediately after the call to SetValue).

	about: Newlines in the text string are the only control characters allowed, and they will cause appropriate line
	breaks.
	<p>
	After the write operation, the insertion point will be at the end of the inserted text, so subsequent write
	operations will be appended. To append text after the user may have interacted with the control,
