bbdoc: This type represents the events generated by a notebook control: currently, there are two of them.
about: The PAGE_CHANGING event is sent before the current page is changed. It allows the program to
examine the current page (which can be retrieved with GetOldSelection()) and to veto the page change
by calling Veto() if, for example, the current values in the controls of the old page are invalid.
<p>
The second event - PAGE_CHANGED - is sent after the page has been changed and the program cannot veto it
any more, it just informs it about the page change.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, if the program is interested in validating the page values before allowing the user to
change it, it should process the PAGE_CHANGING event, otherwise PAGE_CHANGED is probably enough.
In any case, it is probably unnecessary to process both events at once.

	about: Under Windows, GetSelection() will return the same value as GetOldSelection() when

	Also note that the values of selection and old selection returned for an event generated in
	response to a call to wxNotebook::SetSelection shouldn't be trusted as they are currently
	inconsistent under different platforms (but in this case you presumably don't need them anyhow
