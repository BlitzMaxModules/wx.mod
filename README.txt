About wxMax
-----------

wxMax is a BlitzMax language binding for wxWidgets, a widget toolkit for 
creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for cross-platform applications.

It can be used to create full-featured GUI applications on Linux, MacOS and
Windows.


Installing wxMax
----------------

On extracting the archive, you should have a folder called wx.mod
This contains the whole wxMax distribution, and should be placed in your
BlitzMax modules folder :

    BlitzMax/mod

If you have downloaded the binary distribution you can simply start up
your preferred IDE and begin using wxMax immediately with no additional
compilation of the modules.

If you have the source-only distribution, you will need to first run a
Build Modules in order to create binaries for inclusion in your
applications.


Tutorials
---------

There are some in-depth tutorials included with wxMax.
Look in the wx.mod/tutorials folder, and open index.html for access.

We are working on adding localized versions of the tutorials.


Samples
-------

As well as the tutorials, some larger samples are also provided to give you an
idea of the kind of complexity that wxMax is capable of.
You will find the samples in the wx.mod/samples folder.


wxCodeGen
---------

Since writing GUI-based applications can be complicated, special GUI editors
have been created to help you design your layouts graphically.

wxCodeGen is a tool provided with wxMax which can use project files created
by wxFormBuilder to generate a BlitzMax source framework for use in your
application.
This can often reduce the time taken to build a working prototype by many
orders of magnitude (from hours to minutes, for example).

You can find wxCodeGen in the wx.mod/tools folder.
