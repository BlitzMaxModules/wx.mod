bbdoc: This type currently simply presents a simpler to use interface for the wxListCtrl -- it can be thought of as a façade for that complicated type.
about: Using it is preferable to using wxListCtrl directly whenever possible because in the future some
ports might implement wxListView but not the full set of wxListCtrl features.
<p>
Other than different interface, this type is identical to wxListCtrl. In particular, it uses the same
events, same window styles and so on.
