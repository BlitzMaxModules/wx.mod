bbdoc: wxWindow is the base type for all windows and represents any visible object on screen.
about: All controls, top level windows and so on are windows. Sizers and device contexts are not,
however, as they don't appear on screen themselves.
<p>
Please note that all children of the window will be deleted automatically by the destructor before
the window itself is deleted which means that you don't have to worry about deleting them manually.
Please see the window deletion overview for more information.
</p>
<p>
Also note that in this, and many others, wxWidgets classes some GetXXX() methods may be overloaded
(as, for example, GetSize or GetClientSize). In this case, the overloads are non-virtual because having
multiple virtual functions with the same name results in a virtual function name hiding at the derived
class level (in English, this means that the derived class has to override all overloaded variants if it
overrides any of them). To allow overriding them in the derived class, wxWidgets uses a unique protected
virtual DoGetXXX() method and all GetXXX() ones are forwarded to it, so overriding the former changes
the behaviour of the latter.
</p>
<p><b>Styles</b>
<p>
The following styles can apply to all windows, although they will not always make sense
for a particular window class or on all platforms.
</p>
<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_SIMPLE </td><td>Displays a thin border around the window. wxSIMPLE_BORDER is the old name for this style. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_DOUBLE </td><td>Displays a double border. wxDOUBLE_BORDER is the old name for this style. Windows and Mac only. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_SUNKEN </td><td>Displays a sunken border. wxSUNKEN_BORDER is the old name for this style. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_RAISED </td><td>Displays a raised border. wxRAISED_BORDER is the old name for this style. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_STATIC </td><td>Displays a border suitable for a static control. wxSTATIC_BORDER is the old name for this style. Windows only. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_THEME </td><td>Displays a themed border where possible. Currently this has an effect on Windows XP and above only. For more information on themed borders, please see Themed borders on Windows. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxBORDER_NONE </td><td>Displays no border, overriding the default border style for the window. wxNO_BORDER is the old name for this style. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxTRANSPARENT_WINDOW </td><td>The window is transparent, that is, it will not receive paint events. Windows only. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxTAB_TRAVERSAL </td><td>Use this to enable tab traversal for non-dialog windows. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxWANTS_CHARS </td><td>Use this to indicate that the window wants to get all char/key events for all keys - even for keys
like TAB or ENTER which are usually used for dialog navigation and which wouldn't be generated without this style. If you need
to use this style in order to get the arrows or etc., but would still like to have normal keyboard navigation take place, you
should create and send a wxNavigationKeyEvent in response to the key events for Tab and Shift-Tab. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxVSCROLL </td><td>Use this style to enable a vertical scrollbar. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxHSCROLL </td><td>Use this style to enable a horizontal scrollbar. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxALWAYS_SHOW_SB </td><td>If a window has scrollbars, disable them instead of hiding them when they are not needed
(i.e. when the size of the window is big enough to not require the scrollbars to navigate it). This style is currently
implemented for wxMSW, wxGTK and wxUniversal and does nothing on the other platforms. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxCLIP_CHILDREN </td><td>Use this style to eliminate flicker caused by the background being repainted,
then children being painted over them. Windows only. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxFULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE </td><td>Use this style to force a complete redraw of the window whenever it is resized
instead of redrawing just the part of the window affected by resizing. Note that this was the behaviour by default before 2.5.1
release and that if you experience redraw problems with code which previously used to work you may want to try this. Currently
this style applies on GTK+ 2 and Windows only, and full repainting is always done on other platforms. </td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p><b>Extra window styles</b>
<p>
The following are extra styles, set using wxWindow::SetExtraStyle.
</p>
<table width="90%" align="center">
<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>wxWS_EX_VALIDATE_RECURSIVELY </td><td>By default, Validate/TransferDataTo/FromWindow() only work on direct children of the window
(compatible behaviour). Set this flag to make them recursively descend into all subwindows. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxWS_EX_BLOCK_EVENTS </td><td>wxCommandEvents and the objects of the derived classes are forwarded to the parent window and so on
recursively by default. Using this flag for the given window allows to block this propagation at this window, i.e. prevent the events
from being propagated further upwards. Dialogs have this flag on by default. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxWS_EX_TRANSIENT </td><td>Don't use this window as an implicit parent for the other windows: this must be used with transient
windows as otherwise there is the risk of creating a dialog/frame with this window as a parent which would lead to a crash if the
parent is destroyed before the child. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxWS_EX_PROCESS_IDLE </td><td>This window should always process idle events, even if the mode set by wxIdleEvent::SetMode is
wxIDLE_PROCESS_SPECIFIED. </td></tr>
<tr><td>wxWS_EX_PROCESS_UI_UPDATES </td><td>This window should always process UI update events, even if the mode set by
wxUpdateUIEvent::SetMode is wxUPDATE_UI_PROCESS_SPECIFIED. </td></tr>
</table>

	Note that wxWidgets maintains the stack of windows having captured the mouse and when the mouse is released
	the capture returns to the window which had had captured it previously and it is only really released if there

	it, unless the window receives the wxMouseCaptureLostEvent event.
	</p>

	and cancel this operation when it receives the event. The event handler must not recapture mouse.

	Rem
	bbdoc: This method simply generates a wxCloseEvent whose handler usually tries to close the window.
	about: It doesn't close the window itself, however.
	<p>
	Close calls the close handler for the window, providing an opportunity for the window to choose
	whether to destroy the window. Usually it is only used with the top level windows (wxFrame and
	wxDialog classes) as the others are not supposed to have any special OnClose() logic.
	</p>
	<p>
	The close handler should check whether the window is being deleted forcibly, using
	wxCloseEvent::CanVeto, in which case it should destroy the window using wxWindow::Destroy.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that calling Close does not guarantee that the window will be destroyed; but it provides a way
	to simulate a manual close of a window, which may or may not be implemented by destroying the window.
	The default implementation of wxDialog::OnCloseWindow does not necessarily delete the dialog, since
	it will simply simulate an wxID_CANCEL event which is handled by the appropriate button event
	handler and may do anything at all.
	</p>
	<p>
	To guarantee that the window will be destroyed, call wxWindow::Destroy instead

	Rem
	bbdoc: Destroys the window safely.
	about: Use this method instead of the delete operator, since different window classes can be
	destroyed differently. Frames and dialogs are not destroyed immediately when this function
	is called -- they are added to a list of windows to be deleted on idle time, when all the window's
	events have been processed. This prevents problems with events being sent to non-existent windows.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Sizes the window so that it fits around its subwindows.
	about: This method won't do anything if there are no subwindows and will only really work correctly if the
	sizers are used for the subwindows layout. Also, if the window has exactly one subwindow it is better
	(faster and the result is more precise as Fit adds some margin to account for fuzziness of its calculations)
	to call :
	<pre>
    window.SetClientSize(child.GetSize())

	bbdoc: Similar to Fit, but sizes the interior (virtual) size of a window.
	about: Mainly useful with scrolled windows to reset scrollbars after sizing changes that do not trigger a

	<p>
	This method is useful for visual appearance optimization (for example, it is a good idea to use it before
	doing many large text insertions in a row into a wxTextCtrl under wxGTK) but is not implemented on all platforms
	nor for all controls so it is mostly just a hint to wxWidgets and not a mandatory directive.

	bbdoc: This method is (or should be, in case of custom controls) called during window creation to intelligently set up the window visual attributes, that is the font and the foreground and background colours.

	However if some of the parents attributes are explicitly (that is, using SetFont and not SetOwnFont)
	changed and if the corresponding attribute hadn't been explicitly set for this window itself, then this
	window takes the same value as used by the parent. In addition, if the window overrides
	ShouldInheritColours to return false, the colours will not be changed no matter what and only the
	font might.
	<p>
	This rather complicated logic is necessary in order to accommodate the different usage scenarios. The most
	common one is when all default attributes are used and in this case, nothing should be inherited as
	in modern GUIs different controls use different fonts (and colours) than their siblings so they can't
	inherit the same value from the parent. However it was also deemed desirable to allow to simply change
	the attributes of all children at once by just changing the font or colour of their common parent, hence
	in this case we do inherit the parents attributes.

	You can call this function from your application to ensure that your UI is up-to-date at this point (as

	wxUpdateUIEvent::SetMode or wxUpdateUIEvent::SetUpdateInterval to limit the overhead that wxWidgets
	incurs by sending update UI events in idle time.
	<p>
	flags should be a bitlist of one or more of the following values :

	be updated in idle time. Some windows update their elements only when necessary, for example when a menu
	is about to be shown. The following is an example of how to call UpdateWindowUI from an idle function :
	<pre>
	Method OnInternalIdle()
		If wxUpdateUIEvent.CanUpdate(Self) Then
			UpdateWindowUI(wxUPDATE_UI_FROMIDLE)
		End If

bbdoc: wxSizer is the abstract base class used for laying out subwindows in a window.
about: You cannot use wxSizer directly; instead, you will have to use one of the sizer classes derived
from it. Currently there are #wxBoxSizer, #wxStaticBoxSizer, #wxGridSizer, #wxFlexGridSizer and
#wxGridBagSizer.
<p>
The layout algorithm used by sizers in wxWidgets is closely related to layout in other GUI toolkits,
such as Java's AWT, the GTK toolkit or the Qt toolkit. It is based upon the idea of the individual
subwindows reporting their minimal required size and their ability to get stretched if the size of the
parent window has changed. This will most often mean that the programmer does not set the original size
of a dialog in the beginning, rather the dialog will be assigned a sizer and this sizer will be queried
about the recommended size. The sizer in turn will query its children, which can be normal windows, empty
space or other sizers, so that a hierarchy of sizers can be constructed. Note that wxSizer does not
derive from wxWindow and thus does not interfere with tab ordering and requires very little resources
compared to a real window on screen.
</p>
<p>
What makes sizers so well fitted for use in wxWidgets is the fact that every control reports its own
minimal size and the algorithm can handle differences in font sizes or different window (dialog item)
sizes on different platforms without problems. If e.g. the standard font as well as the overall design
of Motif widgets requires more space than on Windows, the initial dialog size will automatically be
bigger on Motif than on Windows.
</p>
<p>
Sizers may also be used to control the layout of custom drawn items on the window. The Add, Insert, and
Prepend functions return a pointer to the newly added wxSizerItem. Just add empty space of the desired
size and attributes, and then use the wxSizerItem::GetRect method to determine where the drawing
operations should take place.
</p>
<p>
Please notice that sizers, like child windows, are owned by the library and will be deleted by it which
implies that they must be allocated on the heap. However if you create a sizer and do not add it to
another sizer or window, the library wouldn't be able to delete such an orphan sizer and in this,
and only this, case it should be deleted explicitly.

bbdoc: The basic idea behind a box sizer is that windows will most often be laid out in rather simple basic geometry, typically in a row or a column or several hierarchies of either.
about: As an example, we will construct a dialog that will contain a text field at the top and two
buttons at the bottom. This can be seen as a top-hierarchy column with the text at the top and
buttons at the bottom and a low-hierarchy row with an OK button to the left and a Cancel button
to the right. In many cases (particularly dialogs under Unix and normal frames) the main window
will be resizable by the user and this change of size will have to get propagated to its children.
In our case, we want the text area to grow with the dialog, whereas the button shall have a fixed
size. In addition, there will be a thin border around all controls to make the dialog look nice and
- to make matter worse - the buttons shall be centred as the width of the dialog changes.
<p>
It is the unique feature of a box sizer, that it can grow in both directions (height and width) but
can distribute its growth in the main direction (horizontal for a row) unevenly among its children.
In our example case, the vertical sizer is supposed to propagate all its height changes to only the
text area, not to the button area. This is determined by the proportion parameter when adding a
window (or another sizer) to a sizer. It is interpreted as a weight factor, i.e. it can be zero,
indicating that the window may not be resized at all, or above zero. If several windows have a value
above zero, the value is interpreted relative to the sum of all weight factors of the sizer, so when
adding two windows with a value of 1, they will both get resized equally much and each half as much
as the sizer owning them. Then what do we do when a column sizer changes its width? This behaviour
is controlled by flags (the second parameter of the Add() function): Zero or no flag indicates that
the window will preserve it is original size, wxGROW flag (same as wxEXPAND) forces the window to
grow with the sizer, and wxSHAPED flag tells the window to change it is size proportionally,
preserving original aspect ratio. When wxGROW flag is not used, the item can be aligned within
available space. wxALIGN_LEFT, wxALIGN_TOP, wxALIGN_RIGHT, wxALIGN_BOTTOM, wxALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL
and wxALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL do what they say. wxALIGN_CENTRE (same as wxALIGN_CENTER) is defined as
(wxALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL | wxALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL). Default alignment is wxALIGN_LEFT |
wxALIGN_TOP.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, any window belonging to a sizer may have border, and it can be specified which
of the four sides may have this border, using the wxTOP, wxLEFT, wxRIGHT and wxBOTTOM constants or
wxALL for all directions (and you may also use wxNORTH, wxWEST etc instead). These flags can be used
in combination with the alignment flags above as the second parameter of the Add() method using the
binary or operator |. The sizer of the border also must be made known, and it is the third parameter
in the Add() method. This means, that the entire behaviour of a sizer and its children can be
controlled by the three parameters of the Add() method.

bbdoc: A flex grid sizer is a sizer which lays out its children in a two-dimensional table with all table fields in one row having the same height and all fields in one column having the same width, but all rows or all columns are not necessarily the same height or width as in the wxGridSizer.
about: A wxFlexGridSizer can also size items equally in one direction but unequally ("flexibly") in the
other. If the sizer is only flexible in one direction (this can be changed using SetFlexibleDirection),
it needs to be decided how the sizer should grow in the other ("non-flexible") direction in order to
fill the available space. The SetNonFlexibleGrowMode method serves this purpose.

bbdoc: This type is used for pseudo-events which are called by wxWidgets to give an application the chance to update various user interface elements.
about: Without update UI events, an application has to work hard to check/uncheck, enable/disable, show/hide,
and set the text for elements such as menu items and toolbar buttons. The code for doing this has to be mixed
up with the code that is invoked when an action is invoked for a menu item or button.
<p>
With update UI events, you define an event handler to look at the state of the application and change UI elements
accordingly. wxWidgets will call your member functions in idle time, so you don't have to worry where to
call this code. In addition to being a clearer and more declarative method, it also means you don't have to
worry whether you're updating a toolbar or menubar identifier. The same handler can update a menu item and
toolbar button, if the identifier is the same.
</p>
<p>
Instead of directly manipulating the menu or button, you call functions in the event object, such as
wxUpdateUIEvent::Check. wxWidgets will determine whether such a call has been made, and which UI element to update.
</p>
<p>
These events will work for popup menus as well as menubars. Just before a menu is popped up, wxMenu::UpdateUI
is called to process any UI events for the window that owns the menu.
</p>
<p>
If you find that the overhead of UI update processing is affecting your application, you can do one or both
of the following:
<ol>
<li>Call wxUpdateUIEvent::SetMode with a value of wxUPDATE_UI_PROCESS_SPECIFIED, and set the extra style
wxWS_EX_PROCESS_UPDATE_EVENTS for every window that should receive update events. No other windows will
receive update events.</li>
<li>Call wxUpdateUIEvent::SetUpdateInterval with a millisecond value to set the delay between updates.
You may need to call wxWindow::UpdateWindowUI at critical points, for example when a dialog is about to be
shown, in case the user sees a slight delay before windows are updated.</li>
</ol>
Note that although events are sent in idle time, defining a wxIdleEvent handler for a window does not affect
this because the events are sent from wxWindow::OnInternalIdle which is always called in idle time.
</p>
<p>
wxWidgets tries to optimize update events on some platforms. On Windows and GTK+, events for menubar items
are only sent when the menu is about to be shown, and not in idle time.
</p>

bbdoc: This type represents the events generated by a control (typically a wxTextCtrl but other windows can generate these events as well) when its content gets copied or cut to, or pasted from the clipboard.
about: There are three types of corresponding events wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_COPY, wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_CUT and
wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_PASTE.
<p>
If any of these events is processed (without being skipped) by an event handler, the corresponding operation
doesn't take place which allows to prevent the text from being copied from or pasted to a control. It is
also possible to examine the clipboard contents in the PASTE event handler and transform it in some way
before inserting in a control -- for example, changing its case or removing invalid characters.
</p>
<p>
Finally notice that a CUT event is always preceded by the COPY event which makes it possible to only process
the latter if it doesn't matter if the text was copied or cut.
</p>
<p>
These events are currently only generated by wxComboBox and under Windows and wxTextCtrl under Windows
and GTK and are not generated for the text controls with wxTE_RICH style under Windows.

bbdoc: This type is used for idle events, which are generated when the system becomes idle.
about: Note that, unless you do something specifically, the idle events are not sent if the system remains idle
once it has become it, e.g. only a single idle event will be generated until something else resulting in more normal
events happens and only then is the next idle event sent again. If you need to ensure a continuous stream of idle
events, you can either use RequestMore method in your handler or call wxWakeUpIdle periodically (for example from
timer event), but note that both of these approaches (and especially the first one) increase the system load and so
should be avoided if possible.
<p>
By default, idle events are sent to all windows (and also wxApp, as usual). If this is causing a significant
overhead in your application, you can call wxIdleEvent::SetMode with the value wxIDLE_PROCESS_SPECIFIED, and set the
wxWS_EX_PROCESS_IDLE extra window style for every window which should receive idle events.
