bbdoc: wxWindow is the base type for all windows and represents any visible object on screen.
about: All controls, top level windows and so on are windows. Sizers and device contexts are not,
however, as they don't appear on screen themselves.
<p>
Please note that all children of the window will be deleted automatically by the destructor before
the window itself is deleted which means that you don't have to worry about deleting them manually.
Please see the window deletion overview for more information.
</p>
<p>
Also note that in this, and many others, wxWidgets classes some GetXXX() methods may be overloaded
(as, for example, GetSize or GetClientSize). In this case, the overloads are non-virtual because having
multiple virtual functions with the same name results in a virtual function name hiding at the derived
class level (in English, this means that the derived class has to override all overloaded variants if it
overrides any of them). To allow overriding them in the derived class, wxWidgets uses a unique protected
virtual DoGetXXX() method and all GetXXX() ones are forwarded to it, so overriding the former changes
the behaviour of the latter.
</p>

	about: Call wxWindow::ReleaseMouse to release the capture.
	<p>
	Note that wxWidgets maintains the stack of windows having captured the mouse and when the mouse is released
	the capture returns to the window which had had captured it previously and it is only really released if there
	were no previous window. In particular, this means that you must release the mouse as many times as you capture
	it, unless the window receives the wxMouseCaptureLostEvent event.
	</p>
	<p>
	Any application which captures the mouse in the beginning of some operation must handle wxMouseCaptureLostEvent
	and cancel this operation when it receives the event. The event handler must not recapture mouse.

	Rem
	bbdoc: This method simply generates a wxCloseEvent whose handler usually tries to close the window.
	about: It doesn't close the window itself, however.
	<p>
	Close calls the close handler for the window, providing an opportunity for the window to choose
	whether to destroy the window. Usually it is only used with the top level windows (wxFrame and
	wxDialog classes) as the others are not supposed to have any special OnClose() logic.
	</p>
	<p>
	The close handler should check whether the window is being deleted forcibly, using
	wxCloseEvent::CanVeto, in which case it should destroy the window using wxWindow::Destroy.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note that calling Close does not guarantee that the window will be destroyed; but it provides a way
	to simulate a manual close of a window, which may or may not be implemented by destroying the window.
	The default implementation of wxDialog::OnCloseWindow does not necessarily delete the dialog, since
	it will simply simulate an wxID_CANCEL event which is handled by the appropriate button event
	handler and may do anything at all.
	</p>
	<p>
	To guarantee that the window will be destroyed, call wxWindow::Destroy instead

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Destroys the window safely.
	about: Use this method instead of the delete operator, since different window classes can be
	destroyed differently. Frames and dialogs are not destroyed immediately when this function
	is called -- they are added to a list of windows to be deleted on idle time, when all the window's
	events have been processed. This prevents problems with events being sent to non-existent windows.

	reenabled again when the parent is.

	<p>
	If no window with such name is found, FindWindowByLabel is called.

	Function FindWindowByName:wxWindow(name:String, parent:wxWindow = Null)
	End Function
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Find a window by its label.
	about: Depending on the type of window, the label may be a window title or panel item label. If parent is Null,
	the search will start from all top-level frames and dialog boxes; if non-NULL, the search will be limited to
	the given window hierarchy. The search is recursive in both cases.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Sizes the window so that it fits around its subwindows.
	about: This method won't do anything if there are no subwindows and will only really work correctly if the
	sizers are used for the subwindows layout. Also, if the window has exactly one subwindow it is better
	(faster and the result is more precise as Fit adds some margin to account for fuzziness of its calculations)
	to call :
	<pre>
    window.SetClientSize(child.GetSize())
	</pre>
	instead of calling Fit.
	End Rem
	Method Fit()
		bmx_wxwindow_fit(wxObjectPtr)
	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Similar to Fit, but sizes the interior (virtual) size of a window.
	about: Mainly useful with scrolled windows to reset scrollbars after sizing changes that do not trigger a
	size event, and/or scrolled windows without an interior sizer. This method similarly won't do anything if
	there are no subwindows.
	End Rem

	End Method
	
	Rem
	bbdoc: Freezes the window or, in other words, prevents any updates from taking place on screen, the window is not redrawn at all.
	about: Thaw must be called to reenable window redrawing. Calls to these two functions may be nested.
	<p>
	This method is useful for visual appearance optimization (for example, it is a good idea to use it before
	doing many large text insertions in a row into a wxTextCtrl under wxGTK) but is not implemented on all platforms
	nor for all controls so it is mostly just a hint to wxWidgets and not a mandatory directive.

	Rem
	bbdoc: Returns the background style of the window.
	about: The background style indicates whether background colour should be determined by the system
	(wxBG_STYLE_SYSTEM), be set to a specific colour (wxBG_STYLE_COLOUR), or should be left to the application
	to implement (wxBG_STYLE_CUSTOM).
	<p>
	On GTK+, use of wxBG_STYLE_CUSTOM allows the flicker-free drawing of a custom background, such as a tiled
	bitmap. Currently the style has no effect on other platforms

	about: For example, for a static control, it will be the minimal size such that the control label is not

	be the same as the size the window would have had after calling Fit.

	bbdoc: This method is (or should be, in case of custom controls) called during window creation to intelligently set up the window visual attributes, that is the font and the foreground and background colours.
	about: By "intelligently" the following is meant: by default, all windows use their own default attributes.
	However if some of the parents attributes are explicitly (that is, using SetFont and not SetOwnFont)
	changed and if the corresponding attribute hadn't been explicitly set for this window itself, then this
	window takes the same value as used by the parent. In addition, if the window overrides
	ShouldInheritColours to return false, the colours will not be changed no matter what and only the
	font might.
	<p>
	This rather complicated logic is necessary in order to accommodate the different usage scenarios. The most
	common one is when all default attributes are used and in this case, nothing should be inherited as
	in modern GUIs different controls use different fonts (and colours) than their siblings so they can't
	inherit the same value from the parent. However it was also deemed desirable to allow to simply change
	the attributes of all children at once by just changing the font or colour of their common parent, hence
	in this case we do inherit the parents attributes.

bbdoc: wxSizer is the abstract base class used for laying out subwindows in a window.
about: You cannot use wxSizer directly; instead, you will have to use one of the sizer classes derived
from it. Currently there are #wxBoxSizer, #wxStaticBoxSizer, #wxGridSizer, #wxFlexGridSizer and
#wxGridBagSizer.
<p>
The layout algorithm used by sizers in wxWidgets is closely related to layout in other GUI toolkits,
such as Java's AWT, the GTK toolkit or the Qt toolkit. It is based upon the idea of the individual
subwindows reporting their minimal required size and their ability to get stretched if the size of the
parent window has changed. This will most often mean that the programmer does not set the original size
of a dialog in the beginning, rather the dialog will be assigned a sizer and this sizer will be queried
about the recommended size. The sizer in turn will query its children, which can be normal windows, empty
space or other sizers, so that a hierarchy of sizers can be constructed. Note that wxSizer does not
derive from wxWindow and thus does not interfere with tab ordering and requires very little resources
compared to a real window on screen.
</p>
<p>
What makes sizers so well fitted for use in wxWidgets is the fact that every control reports its own
minimal size and the algorithm can handle differences in font sizes or different window (dialog item)
sizes on different platforms without problems. If e.g. the standard font as well as the overall design
of Motif widgets requires more space than on Windows, the initial dialog size will automatically be
bigger on Motif than on Windows.
</p>
<p>
Sizers may also be used to control the layout of custom drawn items on the window. The Add, Insert, and
Prepend functions return a pointer to the newly added wxSizerItem. Just add empty space of the desired
size and attributes, and then use the wxSizerItem::GetRect method to determine where the drawing
operations should take place.
</p>
<p>
Please notice that sizers, like child windows, are owned by the library and will be deleted by it which
implies that they must be allocated on the heap. However if you create a sizer and do not add it to
another sizer or window, the library wouldn't be able to delete such an orphan sizer and in this,
and only this, case it should be deleted explicitly.

bbdoc: A flex grid sizer is a sizer which lays out its children in a two-dimensional table with all table fields in one row having the same height and all fields in one column having the same width, but all rows or all columns are not necessarily the same height or width as in the wxGridSizer.
about: A wxFlexGridSizer can also size items equally in one direction but unequally ("flexibly") in the
other. If the sizer is only flexible in one direction (this can be changed using SetFlexibleDirection),
it needs to be decided how the sizer should grow in the other ("non-flexible") direction in order to
fill the available space. The SetNonFlexibleGrowMode method serves this purpose.

bbdoc: This type is used for pseudo-events which are called by wxWidgets to give an application the chance to update various user interface elements.
about: Without update UI events, an application has to work hard to check/uncheck, enable/disable, show/hide,
and set the text for elements such as menu items and toolbar buttons. The code for doing this has to be mixed
up with the code that is invoked when an action is invoked for a menu item or button.
<p>
With update UI events, you define an event handler to look at the state of the application and change UI elements
accordingly. wxWidgets will call your member functions in idle time, so you don't have to worry where to
call this code. In addition to being a clearer and more declarative method, it also means you don't have to
worry whether you're updating a toolbar or menubar identifier. The same handler can update a menu item and
toolbar button, if the identifier is the same.
</p>
<p>
Instead of directly manipulating the menu or button, you call functions in the event object, such as
wxUpdateUIEvent::Check. wxWidgets will determine whether such a call has been made, and which UI element to update.
</p>
<p>
These events will work for popup menus as well as menubars. Just before a menu is popped up, wxMenu::UpdateUI
is called to process any UI events for the window that owns the menu.
</p>
<p>
If you find that the overhead of UI update processing is affecting your application, you can do one or both
of the following:
<ol>
<li>Call wxUpdateUIEvent::SetMode with a value of wxUPDATE_UI_PROCESS_SPECIFIED, and set the extra style
wxWS_EX_PROCESS_UPDATE_EVENTS for every window that should receive update events. No other windows will
receive update events.</li>
<li>Call wxUpdateUIEvent::SetUpdateInterval with a millisecond value to set the delay between updates.
You may need to call wxWindow::UpdateWindowUI at critical points, for example when a dialog is about to be
shown, in case the user sees a slight delay before windows are updated.</li>
</ol>
Note that although events are sent in idle time, defining a wxIdleEvent handler for a window does not affect
this because the events are sent from wxWindow::OnInternalIdle which is always called in idle time.
</p>
<p>
wxWidgets tries to optimize update events on some platforms. On Windows and GTK+, events for menubar items
are only sent when the menu is about to be shown, and not in idle time.
</p>
