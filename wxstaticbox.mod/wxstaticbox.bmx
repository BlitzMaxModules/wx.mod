bbdoc: A static box is a rectangle drawn around other panel items to denote a logical grouping of items.
about: Please note that a static box should <b>not</b> be used as the parent for the controls it contains,
instead they should be siblings of each other. Although using a static box as a parent might work
in some versions of wxWidgets, it results in a crash under, for example, wxGTK.
<p>
Also, please note that because of this, the order in which you create new controls is important.
Create your wxStaticBox control <b>before</b> any siblings that are to appear inside the wxStaticBox
in order to preserve the correct Z-Order of controls.
</p>
